<br /><small>Status: Under Consideration &#9874;</small><br />
<small><strong>In fact:</strong></small> this is partly about firewall; with such view - I feel that this can be interesting feature; and it can be a nice promotion.<br />
<small><strong>Conclusion:</strong></small> Under Consideration too much long. If it was not implemented in some form - maybe it is still actual meanings.<br /><br />

&#9679; <a href="https://community.f-secure.com/t5/Feature-Requests/Feature-request-traffic-lights/idi-p/80027" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Traffic lights for locations</a>

<small><strong>In fact:</strong></small> something like Kill Switch is quite popular ask; unclear does it possible to implement or not; and partly discarded.<br />
